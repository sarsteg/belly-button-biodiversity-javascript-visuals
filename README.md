# Belly Button Biodiversity

The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. In this project, I build an interactive dashboard to explore the database. The results reveal that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
